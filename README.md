# Bank-Microservice
It's a part of a school group project where we developed an app for a restaurant/coffee shop management where my task was to develop this microservice which allows to manage the relationships with banks which can be multiple. The frontend part is not included because it was a collective work.

The microservice was developed using the following technologies:
- SpringBoot
- MySQL.

The frontend was devoloped with Angular.
